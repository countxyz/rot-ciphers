# Rot Ciphers

"If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so
changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made
out. If anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at their meaning, he must
substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the
others." â€”Suetonius, Life of Julius Caesar
